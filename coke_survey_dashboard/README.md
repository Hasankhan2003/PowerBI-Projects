This repository contains a small analytics project that explores market–survey data for Coca‑Cola’s **RedBox** loyalty feature in the CCI NEXT retailer application.

## Project overview

The dataset combines three survey sources:

- Field‑visit survey of outlets capturing REDBOX usage, app awareness, assistance needs, and qualitative comments (Table 1).[3]
- Aggregated awareness and barrier counts for Red Box and CCI NEXT app usage (Table 2).[4][1]
- Call‑center survey of registered CCI NEXT users with account‑level points, redemption behavior, and call remarks (Table 3).[5]

The dashboards in `coke_dashboard.jpg` and `coke_dashboard_2.jpg` summarize key KPIs such as points earned/redeemed, redemption rate, call status, app and REDBOX awareness, usage, and clarity of communication.[2][1]

## Dashboards

The repository includes two Power BI / BI-style report images:

- **Customer points & awareness dashboard** (`coke_dashboard.jpg`):  
  - Shows total points earned (1.36M), total points redeemed (344K), and overall 25% redemption rate.[1]
  - Visualizes call status, redemption vs balance, and detailed breakdown of Red Box awareness and app‑usage barriers (e.g., no Android phone, not using CCI NEXT, issues with the app, preseller using the app on behalf of the customer).[4][1]

- **RedBox market survey dashboard** (`coke_dashboard_2.jpg`):  
  - Summarizes usage of REDBOX (64%), redemption of points (52%), push‑notification reach (61%), story views (45%), and total surveyed outlets (33).
  - Includes distributions for CCI NEXT awareness, clarity of REDBOX campaign text, and sources of assistance (independent, not using, staff/family, FSE).
