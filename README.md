This repository is a collection of **Power BI / analytics projects**, each stored in its own folder with a dedicated README and assets (datasets, report files, and exported dashboards). The main README provides an overview of how the repo is structured and how to work with any current or future project folders.[17]

## Repository structure

- Each project lives in a separate top‑level folder.  
- Every project folder contains:
  - One or more raw data files (typically CSV/Excel).  
  - A BI/Power BI report file (for example, `.pbix`) or notebook/script.  
  - A `README.md` describing that specific project, data model, and dashboards.  
  - Optional exported dashboard images for quick preview.

## Technology stack

While each project can differ slightly, most of them typically use:

- Power BI (or another BI tool) for data modeling and dashboarding.  
- CSV/Excel files as primary data sources.  
- Basic data‑cleaning steps such as type casting, calculated columns/measures, and relationships between tables inside the BI model.
